# script
*A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
before use it we have to understand the  abc of programing*

**A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS HANDBOOKS Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to fo llow in certain situations**.*For example -hotel handbooks may contain steps to follow in different scenarios such as when a guest checks in, when a room needs to be tidied, when a f ire
alarm goes off, and so forth. In any of these scenarios, the employees need to follow only the steps for that one type of event. (You would not want someone going through every single step in the entire handbook while you weren waiting to check in.) Similarly,
in a complex script, the browser
might use only a subset of the
code available at any given time

## Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.The flowcharts show the paths between each step.

Arrows show how the script moves from one task
to the next. The different shapes represent diffâ‚¬rent
types of tasks. In some places there are decisions
which cause the code to follow different paths. you
will meet code that helps you deal with each of these
types of situations.
Some experienced programmers use more complex
diagram styles that are specifically designed to
represent code - however, they have a steeper
learning curve. These informal flowcharts will help
you understand how scripts work while you are in
the process of learning the language.

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions
EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
exp and opert
EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.
JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class.

There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
new string concatenation.(+)
WHAT IS A FUNCTION
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).how can i create function?
