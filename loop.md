# the loop

- ## loop by two way :

1-  **for loop**  :*Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.*

**The for loop has the following syntax:**

**for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed**

2-**while loop**:*The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.*

**while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}**
