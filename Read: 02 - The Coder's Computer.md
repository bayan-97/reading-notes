  *The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs:*
  
**A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title — it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. 
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.**
