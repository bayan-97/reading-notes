## What is a computer?

**A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.**

## *hardware and software?*

**The beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one minute—and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other words, although we don't really think of it this way, the computer can be reprogrammed as many times as you like. This is why programs are also called software. They're "soft" in the sense that they are not fixed: they can be changed easily. By contrast, a computer's hardware—the bits and pieces from which it is made (and the peripherals, like the mouse and printer, you plug into it)—is pretty much fixed when you buy it off the shelf. The hardware is what makes your computer powerful; the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible. That computers can do so many different jobs is what makes them so useful—and that's why millions of us can no longer live without them!**

## Logic and circuits

**At the most basic level, of course, a computer is an electrical circuit build using wires. We'll think of each wire in the circuit as carrying a single information element, called a bit. The word bit comes from Binary digIT, using the term binary because a bit can have either of two possible values, 0 and 1. In electrical terms, you can think of zero volts representing 0 and five volts representing 1; but for our purposes, the specific voltages aren't important — and indeed there are varying systems for interpreting voltage levels as 0 or 1. (People have experimented with more than two different voltage levels, but this ends up leading to circuits that are more complex and end up being less effective than the binary system.)**
