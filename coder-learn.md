# the text editor
**it is part of software that we download and install on our computer, or you access online through your web browser.**

 1-code completion
 2- syntax highlighting

  *software like:

  *The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs:*

**A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title — it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. 

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.**

*i learn many command related linux such as:*

-  mkdir createfolder
 - touh creade file
 - cd .. bring the previous file
